# lucky

Experiments calculating lucky numbers with Clojure.  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_number


Nice demonstration of a huge performance win with data.avl in the Clojure contrib library.

## Usage

Not a library, just some sample code.  The last function in lucky.clj, lucky-avl, is the one
to use.
